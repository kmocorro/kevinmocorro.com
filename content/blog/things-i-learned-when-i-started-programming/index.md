It all started when I was so naive with MS Excel VBA thinking I can automate things and I could apply it to solve every corporate problems with it.

A friend of mine challenged me to start creating a CRUD web app. I don't even know what is CRUD back then. I just realized that he opened a new opportunity for me by asking:

>Did you know any *concepts?* Have you ever heard about *threads*? Any *algorithms* in mind you want to share?

I can't say anything because I don't know.

I was in a shock and in complete silence.

>But I already know VBA and the concept of it. I think I can work on that.

I can see that he's not impressed with it.

>Kevin, those programming languages are just **tools**. I don't care if you're an expert on that language. 5 to 10 years from now who knows if that language is still relevant.

So what I did was I started digging up on program structures, loops, controls, functions and each syntax to every programming languages I have encountered and become familiar with it.

So after several years, I could say that it's not easy but there are lessons that I'd want to share with you to keep you going.

###Here are the things that I have learned when I started programming:

####1.You cannot learn everything

It's going to take you forever to keep up with every programming languages because it's going to change every time. The code structure that you're so fond of might change it could still be there in the near future though who knows for how long. Take ReactJS for example with Hooks. So, choose what you *need* to learn and focus on getting results.

For me, I started with JavaScript, NodeJS, MySQL and Bash scripting. The key is start using things and play around with it. I actually bought online courses and every evening I used to watch it and challenge myself to learn from it through small projects and tutorials.

####2.Start with a project

>Don't imitate the tutorials, understand. 

I think this is the best way to learn programming, aside from having ***the ability to learn quickly***.

You might think you're so good with a certain language when you follow it step-by-step. But when you go out and face real problems, you'll eventually feel that it's hard and things not falling into place. Because the key is to understand, understand the concepts of a certain procedure, terminologies, syntax etc.

In JavaScript, I am thankful that I have learned syntax parsers, execution context, lexical environment, objects, arguments, loops etc. Try understanding the concepts of your selected programming language and eventually you'll find yourself enjoying in solving problems using code.

This can be done by starting or creating a project. I remember started creating my intranet web app for building prototypes and the basics of CRUD.

####3.Don't be afraid to make mistakes

I know it sounds a clich√© right? But it's true. When you're afraid about something, you tend not to do anything and just wait for it to happen.

People often think of me as a trying hard professional but what they don't know is that I have tried several work arounds to make things done. The code is not optimal, not properly written but still I was able to launch my first web app. I need to get things rolling, I need to get things done.

That's the key to understanding, you'll never get the first things right. Nothing is completely perfect and that's how programming is. It's okay to wrap things up and learn from your mistakes and try again.

####4.Create a Prototype

When you're starting into the development stage assuming you already know what you're going to do based on the requirements of the project. I won't suggest to make things scalable, perfect, state-of-the-art piece of code at first. Instead, I'd suggest make a prototype and see how it works and then if things goes well or your prototype shows real potential or value then you can start investing time to making the code more structured, more solid, scalable and everything like that. 

It's okay to make mistakes and having a prototype will help you to keep going. There are a lot of good ways to code but don't let it stop you from coding. 

####5.Focus on the project not on the technology

I heard some of my colleagues discussing about which is better. Angular or React, PHP or NodeJS. At first, it's interesting to hear the different sides and pros and cons of each technologies and frameworks but in reality you just have to choose depends on your needs or project that you'll work on.

I remember my friend once told me that they're just tools. Tools to be used for certain tasks. I realized that being a software engineer is just like a carpenter, you need tools on your belt and each tools has a purpose. You don't use a pliers in hammering a nail. Uhm, well you can, but it's not efficient.

You get my point. Your customer or client won't care about what technology you throw in it. They need to see the results based on their requirements and that's what matters.

Solving their problem is the reason why they are paying you.

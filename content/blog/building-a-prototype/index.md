There are lot of things I have learned when I am working with corporate sponsors or clients. One of which is ***Don't waste your time***.

####Don't waste your time

It's exciting when people asks for your help. You gave them an idea on how to solve it then they'll say *"Oh! That's a very good idea! We will definitely consider that."* and then they'll come to ask you to create a quick illustration or **prototype** based on the initial discussion. Right off the bat, you have done it but later you found out they threw you under the bus because it failed miserably.

Some ideas are not good, but only you can verify if it's *useful* or not. Having a prototype without considering its purpose and what it's trying to solve is like building a paper plane with rockets in it. Only to realize, that your client needs a paper plane with smoke trail in it. 

There will be some point in your life that you will spend lots of hours trying to build something thinking that they need it but in reality, ***they don't***.

>If the idea didn't come from them, don't add it on the prototype!

When you're working with clients or corporate sponsors, over-flowery sentences or phrases to sell your idea won't work. They want to see proof that it is working. Is the ROI considerable? How will your idea benefit the company? etc.

Evaluate the problem and understand their situation first by asking them questions like: *What are you trying to solve?* *Did the problem came from an existing program?* *How can we improve it without making another prototype or actual item?*

**Don't waste your time building a *perfect* prototype to solve a problem.**

If there's a need, work on it by analyzing the problem, gathering all the functional requirements and considering the scope *before* building it.

There are a lot of things that I have learned when I am working with a corporate sponsors or clients. One of which is ***Don't waste your time***.

####Don't waste your time

It's exciting when people asks for your help. You gave them an idea on how to solve it then they'll say *"Oh! That's a very good idea! We will definitely consider that."* and then they came back and asks you to create a quick illustration or **prototype** based on the initial discussion. Right off the bat, you have done it but later you found out they threw you under the bus because it failed miserably.

Some ideas are not good but only you can see it's *useful*. Having a prototype without considering its purpose and what it's trying to solve is like building a paper plane with rockets in it. Only to realize, that your client needs a paper plane with smoke trail in it. 

There will be some point in your life that you will spend a lot of hours trying to build something thinking that they need it but in reality, ***they don't***.

>If the idea didn't came from them, don't add it on the prototype!

When you're working with clients or corporate sponsors, over-flowery sentences or phrases to sell your idea won't work. They want to see proof that it is working, does the ROI considerable?, how's your idea will benefit the company? etc.

Evaluate the problem and understand their situation first by asking them questions like: *What are you trying to solve?* *Does the problem came from the existing program?* *How can we improve it without making another prototype or actual item?*

**Don't waste your time building a *perfect* prototype to solve a problem.**

If there's a need, work on it by analyzing the problem, gathering all the functional requirements and considering the scope *before* building it.
